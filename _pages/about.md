About me
======
My name is Agustín Nolasco, I am a Computer Science PhD. Student in [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/). I currently collaborate in the research group [MFIS](https://mfis.dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/people).
I recently finished my thesis under the supervision of [Facundo Molina](https://facumolina.github.io/), [Renzo Degiovanni](https://rdegiovanni.github.io/) and [Nazareno Aguirre](https://nmaguirre.github.io/). In my thesis we present MemoRIA, an approach to infere metamorphic relations automatically. Our paper, titled "Abstraction-Aware Inference Of Metamorphic Relations" is directly related with my thesis.
I am working as teaching assistant in the course of Design of Algorithms in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Río Cuarto.
